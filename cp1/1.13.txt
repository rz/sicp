First let us prove that Fib(n) = (phi^n - psi^n)/sqrt(5).

Holds for n=1: Fib(1) = 1 and phi - psi = (1 + sqrt(5) - 1 + sqrt(5))/2 = sqrt(5)

Next, note that both phi and psi are solutions to x^2 = x + 1.
Multiplying both sides by x^(n-1) we obtain taht they also satisfy
x^(n+1) = x^n + x^(n-1).  So, if the desired formula holds for n and
n-1 it also holds for n+1.

Now, for n>0 |psi^n/sqrt(5)| < 1/2 neglecting that term can't possibly
change the value by a whole integer. Thus the closest integer to
phi^n/sqrt(5) is Fib(n). Do notice that as n becomes large the psi
term contributes less and less.
