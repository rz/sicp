Each call to cc does 2 recursive calls. This generates 2 branches. One branch decreases the amount linearly, so this branch generates O(n) steps. The other branch, keeps the amount constant while reducing kinds-of-coins by 1 each time. Each call, therefore generates n*n ...*n kinds-of-coins times ie O(n^5).
