Since the interpreter uses applicative order, it tries to evaluate the
inner-most sqrt-iter in the process of evaluating the outermost, which
in turn results in the interpreter trying to evaluate another
"sqrt-iter", and this results in infinite recursion. 

Note that in clisp the error seems to be different: as if the
sqrt-iter in the new-if were "undefined" ie there is no sqrt-iter in
that scope.
