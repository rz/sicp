Since intervals don't have well-behaved additive and multiplicative inverses, as we showed
in the previous 3 problems and not every formula can be reduced so that each symbol
appears only once, it is impossible to design a system without this flaw.

However, making some assumptions about how errors are distributed e.g. if we think of an interval
A = a +/ e as a probability distribution with values normally distributed, centered at a
and with standard deviation e, we can produce a system with better properties.
