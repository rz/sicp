Eva is right.

S'pose we have A = a +/- e. For each arithmetic operation, whenever we repeat A, we
increase the error bounds:

+: A + A = 2a +/- 2e
-: A - A = 0 +/- 2e
*: A * A = a^2 +/- 2ea
/: A / A = 1 +/- 2ea

In particular, we we write an expression as B = B + 0 = B + A - A and the error in A is
greater than the error in B, the error in the expression is larger than the error in B.

Similarly, with division (as we've seen in the previous problems) if we write B as
B = B * 1 = B * A / A we increase the error by 2eA.

This means that intervals have different algebraic properties than numbers -- in
particular when A is an interval we don't have additive or multiplicative inverses
(i.e. A - A != 0 and A / A != 1). This is what happens with the equivalence resistor
formula -- it assumes that we have well-behaved inverses when we don't and that's why the
two formulas produce different intervals.

Furthermore, this means that if we reduce expressions to use fewer instances of intervals,
the error bounds will be tighter (since they increase each time we repeat a quantity in
the formula, as we saw above).
